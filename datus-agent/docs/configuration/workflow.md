# Workflow

Configure workflow orchestration in Datus Agent to define execution plans, node sequences, parallel processing, and sub-workflow composition. Workflows control how nodes are executed to process user queries and generate SQL.

!!! tip "Quick Start"
    New to workflows? Start with the [Basic Workflow Configuration](#basic-workflow-configuration) section to understand the fundamentals.

## Workflow Structure

Workflows are defined in the configuration file under the `workflow` section:

```yaml title="agent.yml"
workflow:
  plan: planA                        # Active execution plan

  # Define execution plans inside workflow
  planA:
    - schema_linking
    - gen_sql
    - output

  planB:
    - schema_linking
    - gen_sql
    - execute_sql
    - reflect
    - output
```

## Basic Workflow Configuration

### Simple Sequential Workflow

```yaml title="Simple Sequential Workflow"
workflow:
  plan: basic_sql

  basic_sql:
    - schema_linking                   # Find relevant tables
    - gen_sql                     # Create SQL query
    - output                          # Format results
```

### Workflow with Execution and Reflection

```yaml title="Workflow with Execution and Reflection"
workflow:
  plan: with_execution

  with_execution:
    - schema_linking                   # Find relevant tables
    - gen_sql                     # Create SQL query
    - execute_sql                     # Run the query
    - reflect                         # Analyze results
    - output                          # Format final output
```

## Advanced Workflow Features

!!! warning "Advanced Features"
    The following features require careful planning and understanding of node dependencies. Test thoroughly in development environments.

### Parallel Execution

Execute multiple nodes simultaneously and then select the best result:

```yaml title="Parallel Execution Example"
workflow:
  plan: parallel_generation

  parallel_generation:
    - schema_linking
    - parallel:                       # Execute in parallel
        - gen_sql
        - reasoning
    - selection                       # Choose best result
    - execute_sql
    - output
```

### Sub-workflows

Break complex workflows into reusable sub-components:

```yaml title="Sub-workflows Example"
workflow:
  plan: multi_approach

  multi_approach:
    - schema_linking
    - parallel:
        - subworkflow1
        - subworkflow2
        - subworkflow3
    - selection
    - execute_sql
    - output

  # Define sub-workflows
  subworkflow1:
    - search_metrics
    - gen_sql

  subworkflow2:
    - search_metrics
    - reasoning

  subworkflow3:
    - reasoning
    - reflect
```

### Sub-workflows with Custom Configuration

Each sub-workflow can use its own configuration file:

```yaml title="Sub-workflows with Custom Configuration"
workflow:
  plan: multi_agent

  multi_agent:
    - schema_linking
    - parallel:
        - subworkflow1
        - subworkflow2
        - subworkflow3
    - selection
    - execute_sql
    - output

  subworkflow1:
    steps:
      - search_metrics
      - gen_sql
    config: multi/agent1.yaml          # Custom config file

  subworkflow2:
    steps:
      - search_metrics
      - reasoning
    config: multi/agent2.yaml

  subworkflow3:
    steps:
      - reasoning
      - reflect
    config: multi/agent3.yaml
```

## Built-in Workflow Plans

Datus Agent provides three built-in workflow plans if you don't configure custom ones:

!!! info "Default Workflows"
    These workflows are automatically available and can be referenced without additional configuration.

=== "Reflection Workflow"

    ```yaml
    # Built-in: reflection
    reflection:
      - schema_linking
      - gen_sql
      - execute_sql
      - reflect
      - output
    ```

=== "Fixed Workflow"

    ```yaml
    # Built-in: fixed
    fixed:
      - schema_linking
      - gen_sql
      - execute_sql
      - output
    ```

=== "Metric-to-SQL Workflow"

    ```yaml
    # Built-in: metric_to_sql
    metric_to_sql:
      - schema_linking
      - search_metrics
      - date_parser
      - gen_sql
      - execute_sql
      - output
    ```

## Reflection Nodes Configuration

Configure alternative workflows that can be triggered during reflection:

```yaml title="Reflection Nodes Configuration"
reflection_nodes:
  # When schema linking needs improvement
  schema_linking:
    - schema_linking
    - gen_sql
    - execute_sql
    - reflect

  # When document search is needed
  doc_search:
    - doc_search
    - gen_sql
    - execute_sql
    - reflect

  # Simple regeneration
  simple_regenerate:
    - execute_sql
    - reflect

  # Enhanced reasoning
  reasoning:
    - reasoning
    - execute_sql
    - reflect
```
