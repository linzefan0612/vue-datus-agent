"""Shared helpers for the visual-artifact subagents (report + dashboard)
and the matching artifact tool implementations.

Both ``GenVisualReportAgenticNode`` / ``GenVisualDashboardAgenticNode``
*and* the underlying ``ReportArtifactTools`` / ``DashboardArtifactTools``
need a tiny shared toolbox:

* ``utc_now_iso()`` — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp at second precision used
  for ``executed_at`` / ``saved_at`` / ``created_at`` fields.
* ``extract_artifact_result_field`` / ``extract_artifact_result_list`` —
  walk a recorded :class:`ActionHistory.output` envelope to pull out
  fields like ``app_jsx_path`` or ``render_files``.

The earlier ``rpt_<slug>_<yymmdd>_<rand>`` allocator and the matching
``detect_referenced_artifact_ids`` inline-scan helper are gone: the LLM
now picks a bare ``slug`` directly (the system prompt forces a ``glob``
of the kind root for uniqueness), so there's nothing to allocate and
nothing to inline-detect.

# tools both need to perform once we landed the analysis/ directory:

#   * ``append_intent_section`` — append-only writes to ``intent.md``,
#     filtered through ``_is_meaningful_intent`` so renderer error reports
#     and "continue" placeholders never reach the file.

#     datasource to ``manifest.datasources`` if it isn't already there.
#   * ``write_query_brief`` — write ``queries/<name>.brief.json``.
#
# Each helper is best-effort: failures are logged and surfaced as a string
# error message but never raise, so the caller can decide whether to bubble
# the issue up as a hard FuncToolResult error (e.g. for save_query, where
# missing brief metadata makes the artifact incomplete) or treat it as
# a soft warning (e.g. for intent.md, where the SQL is the load-bearing
# artifact and the prompt log is bonus).
